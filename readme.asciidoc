# Devops with Java EE

## TODO

### P1

. Instructions to setup Docker network on local machine
. Instructions to setup email server on local machine
. How to configure JBoss EAP to run Arquillian tests on OpenShift (something similar to WildFly/OpenShift adapter)
. Configure email server as Docker container
. DNS nameserver of the virtual machine needs to be configured in Jenkins (or local machine)
. DONE - Login with `developer` account, instead of `jenkins`
. DONE - Change app's name to include QA, UAT, Dev, could be the version/build number
. DONE - Clean up Docker images to minimal size
. Send an email to release user indicating that the build is ready to be pushed
. DONE - Remove parallel execution of UAT and QA test
. DONE - Remove Dev (only) app (ticketmonsterVersionNumberSNAPSHOT) after successful execution. This frees up space for subsequent executions.
. Show a failed test scenario
. Run integration tests in JBoss EAP cartridge
. DONE - Move Sonar as a separate step in BUILD stage

### P2

. Rollback to previous version
. Quick mode vs Full mode - this will not recreate OpenShift application, instead just redeploy the WAR

. DONE - Installed Workspace Cleanup Plugin (https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Workspace+Cleanup+Plugin)
  in order to cleanup jenkins jobs workspaces to save disk space

DONE - New version (not officially distributed and downloadable yet) of Openshift Deployer plugin for Jenkins in order to create/delete APP NAME based on a mix of fixed string + VARIABLE e.g: ticketmonster218SNAPSHOT (using the the standard plugin you cannot use a variable in app name). BTW, Openshift API doesn't accept APP NAME with non-alphanumeric characters.
. DONE - Disable Maven archiving in Jenkins server configto save disk space 
. DONE - Disable artifacts archiving in some jenkins jobs to save disk space
. DONE - Home page jenkins http://localhost:8082/jenkins instead of http://localhost:8082/
