# Devops with Java EE

. Instructions and links to content available at https://github.com/amorena/democdonpaas

## DONE

. DONE - Improved performance - end to end process is quicker
. DONE - Changed the network configuration of docker containers (removed net=Host) and now all containers are just linked using "links"
. DONE - Created email server docker containers (imap and email web client) (no more external inboxs)
. DONE - Changed app's name for DEV to include ver number + SNAPSHOT
. DONE - Cleaned up Docker images to minimal size
. DONE - Configured send emails to developer, tester and release
. DONE - Removed parallel execution of UAT and QA test
. DONE - Added teardown job to remove DEV Openshift online env(ticketmonsterVerNumSNAPSHOT) after successful build, deploy and test. This frees up space for subsequent build executions.
. DONE - Moved Sonar as a separate step in BUILD stage
. DONE - Configure 3 apps in the same domain (this is an out-of-the-box Openshift feature)
. DONE - Installed Workspace Cleanup Plugin (https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Workspace+Cleanup+Plugin) in order to cleanup jenkins jobs workspaces to save disk space
. DONE - New version (not officially distributed and downloadable yet) of Openshift Deployer plugin for Jenkins in order to create/delete APP-NAME based on a mix of fixed string + VARIABLE e.g: ticketmonster218SNAPSHOT (Note: using the previous version of the plugin you cannot use a variable in app name). BTW, Openshift API doesn't accept APP NAME with non-alphanumeric characters.
. DONE - Disabled Maven archiving in Jenkins server config to save disk space 
. DONE - Disabled artifacts archiving in some jenkins jobs to save disk space
. DONE - Changed Jenkins Server Home page http://localhost:8082/jenkins
. DONE - Added "Prod test" job
. DONE - Uploaded all docker images on Docker Registry Hub https://registry.hub.docker.com/repos/amorena
. DONE - Configured automatic trigger (Jnkins build step) in JBDS (Commit-Push) and CLI (git push)
. DONE - Installed and configured openssh in Jenkins container in order to configure GIT Server
. DONE - Failed test scenario (could be triggered during the demo (e.g: mistakes in the app code or others)
. DONE - Quick mode vs Full mode - this will not recreate OpenShift application, instead just redeploy the WAR. I'll configure this for the Rollback job
. DONE - Created an updated demo scenario diagram available at https://github.com/amorena/democdonpaas 
. DONE - Rollback to previous version can be done using "rebuild" button of deploy-prod job then selecting ARTIFACT VERSION
. DONE - Configured Arquillian tests on OpenShift (local VM or online) JBoss EAP gears of Ticketmonster UAT. Too slow so I've removed this kind of test and configured a set of curl to test tickemonster key services availability in "QA tests", "UAT tests" and "PROD tests"
