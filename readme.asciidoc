# Devops with Java EE

## TODO

### P1

. Instructions to setup Docker network on local machine
. Instructions to setup email server on local machine
. How to configure JBoss EAP to run Arquillian tests on OpenShift (something similar to WildFly/OpenShift adapter)
. Configure email server as Docker container
. DNS nameserver of the virtual machine needs to be configured in Jenkins (or local machine)
. Login with `developer` account, instead of `jenkins`
. Change app's name to include QA, UAT, Dev, could be the version/build number
. Clean up Docker images to minimal size
. Send an email to release user indicating that the build is ready to be pushed
. Remove parallel execution of UAT and QA test
. Remove Dev, QA, Test domains after successful execution. This frees up space for subsequent executions.
. Show a failed test scenario
. Run integration tests in JBoss EAP cartridge
. Move Sonar as a separate step in BUILD stage

### P2

. Rollback to previous version
. Quick mode vs Full mode - this will not recreate OpenShift application, instead just redeploy the WAR
. Ability to configure 3 apps in the same domain
